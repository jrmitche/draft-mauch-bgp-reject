           <t>This document defines the default behaviour of a BGP speaker when
            no explicit policy is associated with a BGP peering session.</t>

    <section anchor="Introduction" title="Introduction">
<t>
    BGP <xref target="RFC4271" /> speakers have many default settings which need to be revisited
    as part of improving the routing ecosystem.  There is a need to provide
    guidace to BGP implementors for the default behaviors of a well functioning
    internet ecosystem.  Routing leaks <xref target="I-D.ietf-idr-route-leak-detection-mitigation" />
    are part of the problem, but software defects and operator misconfigurations
    are just a few of the attacks on internet stability we aim to address.
</t>

<t>
    Usually BGP speakers accept all routes from a configured peer or
    neighbor. This practice dates back to the early days of internet protocols
    in being very permissive in offering routing information to allow all
    networks to reach each other.  With the core of the internet becoming more
    densely interconnected the risk of a misbehaving edge device or BGP
    speaking customer poses signficiant risks to the reachability of critical
    services.
</t>

<t>
    This proposal intends to solve this situation with the requiring the
    explicity configuration of BGP policy for any non-iBGP speaking session
    such as customers, peers or confederation boundaries. When this solution is
    implemented, devices will no longer pass routes without explicit
    policy.

    <section anchor="Requirements" title="Solution Requirements">
        <t>The following requirements apply to the solution described in this document:
        <list style="symbols">
            <t>Software MUST mark any routes from an eBGP peer as 'invalid' in the Adj-RIB-In, if no explicit policy was configured.</t>
            <t>Software MUST NOT advertise any routes to an eBGP peer without an operator configuring a policy</t>
            <t>Software MUST NOT require a configuration directive to operate in this mode.</t>
            <t>Software MUST provide protection from internal failures preventing the advertisement and acceptance of routes</t>
            <t>Software MAY provide a configuration option to disable this security capability.</t>
            </list>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
        <t>This document addresses the basic security posture of a BGP speaking device within a network. Operators have a need for implementors to address the problem through a behavior change to mitigate against possible attacks from a permissive security posture.  Attacks and inadvertent advertisements cause business impact necessitating this default behavior.</t>
